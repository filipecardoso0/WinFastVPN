        <h2 class="mt-3">Privacy Policy</h2>

        <div>
            <p>We want you to understand what information we collect, what we don’t collect, and how we collect, use, and store information. We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration.</p>
            <p>Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required to operate a world-class VPN service at scale. We designed our systems to not have sensitive data about our customers; even when compelled, we cannot provide data that we do not possess.</p>
            <p>This privacy policy will help you understand how WinFastVPN (“WinFastVPN,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and stores information.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="mt-3">General Information</h2>

        <div>
            <p>WinFastVPN collects two types of information:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Information related to your account (“personal information”)</li>
                    <p>This information is collected for the purpose of administering your WinFastVPN subscription and includes your email address, and payment information, which you submit on our order page when you subscribe for the Services.</p>
                <li>Aggregate Apps and VPN connection summary statistics</li>
                    <p>WinFastVPN collects minimal information about usage in order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service. The section below specifies in detail what information we collect. These statistics never include anything about what the user did with the VPN: no data about the contents or destinations of VPN traffic, no DNS queries, and no IP addresses.</p>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Personal Information</h2>

        <div>
            <p>WinFastVPN collects personal information that you provide to us directly through the Site. We require that you provide personal information, such as an email address and payment information, in order to establish an WinFastVPN account, and so that we can email you, collect payments from you, and respond to support queries that you initiate.</p>
            <p>With some forms of payment, the Site may redirect you to the website of a third-party payment processor (namely PayPal) to complete the transaction. To understand what personal information these processors collect and store, please refer to the respective processor's terms and privacy policy.</p>
            <p>WinFastVPN uses your email address for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To send emails related to payment transactions.</li>
                <li>To provide links to our Site, including password reset emails.</li>
                <li>To send you updates and announcements.</li>
                <li>To communicate with you about your VPN services or respond to your communications.</li>
                <li>To send marketing information, such as WinFastVPN offers, surveys, invitations, and content about other matters in connection with WinFastVPN (“Marketing emails”). You may choose to not receive Marketing emails by following the opt-out procedure described in these emails.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>WinFastVPN uses your personal information only for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, and we do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Aggregate Apps and VPN Connection Summary Statistics</h2>

        <div>
            <p>We ensure that we never log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries. Therefore:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.</li>
                <li>We do not know which user was connected to the VPN at a specific time or which VPN server IP addresses they used.</li>
                <li>We do not know the set of original IP addresses of a user’s computer.</li>
                <p>Should anyone try to compel WinFastVPN to release user information based on any of the above, we cannot supply this information because the data don’t exist.</p>
                <p>In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, WinFastVPN collects the following information related to your VPN usage:</p>
            </ul>
            <strong><p>Successful Connection</p></strong>
            <ol>
                <li>We collect information about whether you have successfully established a VPN connection on a particular day and the time of the day, to which VPN location, and your source IP address. This minimal information assists us in providing technical support, such as identifying connection problems, providing country-specific advice about how to best use our Service, and to enable WinFastVPN engineers to identify and fix network issues.</li>
            </ol>
            <strong><p>Aggregate Sum of Data Transferred (In MB)</p></strong>
            <ol>
                <li>We collect information regarding the total sum of data transferred by a given user. Although we provide unlimited data transfer, if we notice that a single user pushes more traffic than thousands of others combined, thereby affecting the quality of service for other WinFastVPN users, we may contact that user for an explanation.</li>
                <li>We collect information regarding the total duration of the connection to the service. This minimal information assists us to, among others, monitor the load on our various servers and indicate to our subscribers which locations are currently less frequented, so where they would have the most reliable connection.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Storing of Information Related to Email, Live Chat, and Feedback Forms</h2>

        <div>
            <p>WinFastVPN keeps records of any correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit to us through our Site or Services, along with our response.

Having full correspondence records enables our staff and third-parties which assist us in the customer service to provide the best possible customer support experience.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Security Measures to Protect Your Information</h2>

        <div>

            <p>While we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data security measures in the world can offer 100% protection.</p>
