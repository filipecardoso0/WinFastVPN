# WIN FAST VPN - THE WEBSITE 

## IMPORTANT NOTES 

This is website done by github.com/filipecardoso0.
It has been done using the Php Framework Laravel, as well as the CSS framework Bootstrap 5. 
In addition, vanilla JS was used to perform AJAX Request, as well as the PAYPAL SDK in order to provide payment support using PAYPAL and credit card. 

Finally, this VPN was exclusively design for Call Of Duty: Warzone 2 (The video game) and has no link with any of Activision's products whatsoever.
The purpose of Win Fast VPN is to provide players easy lobbies by routing only a small percentage of the traffic between the client and the Call of Duty's servers, so Call of Duty's servers think that the player is on a different location, therefore bypassing their Skill Based Matchmaking Feature.
